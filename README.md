Curiosity
=========

Curiosity killed the cat....

You need to fill at least 90% of your hunger and sleepiness bars.
You can sleep on a bed, wich is better than sleeping on the sofa, but unsafer...
Yeah because if you annoy too much the humans, you gonna die...
Oh and by the way... Avoid being in the same room alone with Curiosity...

Point and click ! And enjoy :D
